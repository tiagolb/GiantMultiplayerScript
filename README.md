Script Installation
===================

First you need to install pip:
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
```
  
Then you should navigate to the script directory and enter the following command:
```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  
Then you are good to go!!

Cron Installation
=================

I suggest you use cron in order to have the script run automatically every hour or so.
There are a lot of online tutorials to do it.

Google is your friend!
